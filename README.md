Stars on GitHub are really handy for bookmarking interesting projects on GitHub. Unfortunately, I find the built-in list of starred repositories a bit slow and clunky to use, so I've built my own!

- View all your starred repositories at once - no pagination no anything, it's all there right away
- Start typing anywhere on the page to filter repository names, descriptions, authors, and languages
- Quickly access the repository, the website, or the author's GitHub profile
- Fast, accessible, and looks good ðŸ¥°

## Development

The app is built on a pretty standard [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org) stack, run by [Netlify Dev](https://www.netlify.com/products/dev/) to enable local development and testing of serverless functions.

To get started, install dependencies using `npm install`. Because Stargaze relies on GitHub's GraphQL API and OAuth flow, you'll also need to [create an OAuth app](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/creating-an-oauth-app) in the developer section in your profile settings. For local development, the following settings should work:

- Homepage URL: `http://localhost:1234`
- Authorization Callback URL: `http://localhost:1234`

Next, create a `.env` file in the root of your repository. This is where sensitive information like the app secret will be stored. The file should look like this:

```bash
VUE_APP_AUTH_CLIENT_ID=<GitHub app ID>
AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=<GitHub app secret>

# Where to redirect after successful authorization
VUE_APP_AUTH_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:8888/auth

# Login API endpoints
VUE_APP_AUTH_URL=https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize
AUTH_TOKEN_URL=https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token

# URL of the serverless function to retrieve the login token
VUE_APP_AUTH_TOKEN_URL=http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/token

# GraphQL API endpoint
VUE_APP_GRAPHQL_HTTP=https://api.github.com/graphql
```

Once all is set up, you have the following npm scripts available to run common development tasks:

- Compile and start dev server: `npm start`
- Build for production: `npm run build`
- Run tests: `npm run test:unit` (there will be tests soon, I promise! ðŸ¤ž)
- Lint and fix files: `npm run lint`

## Deploy to Netlify

Deployment to Netlify should be unproblematic, just link the repository to a new Netlify app. Most of the configuration is taken care of already by the [netlify.toml file](netlify.toml). The only thing left to do is to create another GitHub app for production, and set the above environment variables in the site settings on Netlify.
