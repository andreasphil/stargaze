## Development

The site is a [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org) app built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev). The following commands are available for developing and running the app:

```sh
npm run dev       # Start development server
npm run build     # Create a production bundle
npm run preview   # Serve the production bundle locally
```

## Deployment

Deployment should work out of the box when linking the repository to a project on [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

## Credits

Apart from the open source packages listed in [package.json](package.json), Stargaze uses favicons generated with [IconKitchen](https://icon.kitchen/)

Thanks 🙏
